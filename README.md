# web-api-quiz-project

This project was to build a online quiz with high scores, local storage and an adjusting timer.

It has been a challenge to get a few aspects of this application to work, namely the timer being adjusted by the question answers.

I did receive some help with this during tutor sessions.

This was useful learning about storing information locally, as well as having reactive elements on the site.
